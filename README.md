# public_html

This repo contains the public HTML files to my personal website: 
<https://www.davidbuzzell.com>. This git repo is synced up to the website through
PR triggers that push updates through FTP upon any successful PR merge. All of the
code in this repo is written by David Buzzell (unless explicitly sited as an 
external source in the code), reach out to mail@davidbuzzell.com for any questions.

## Next tasks

In order to keep track of the next tasks for this website, I have implemented a 
Kanban board to prioritize them into cards. Anyone is able to view the board and
leave comments for suggestions and improvements for my website.
