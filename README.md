This repo contains the public HTML files to my personal website:
<https://www.davidbuzzell.com>. This git repo (public viewing, private
contribution) is synced up to the website through PR triggers that push
updates through FTP upon any successful PR merge. All of the code in
this repo is written by David Buzzell (unless explicitly sited as an
external source in the code), contact [mail@davidbuzzell.com](mailto:mail@davidbuzzell.com)
for any questions.

## Next tasks

In order to keep track of the next tasks for this website, I have implemented
a Kanban board to prioritize them into cards. Anyone is able to view the
board and leave comments for suggestions and improvements for my website.

Feel free to [leave suggestions](https://github.com/xhamyd/public_html/issues/33)
on my Github Board.
